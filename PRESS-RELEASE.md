There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > New kitchen group video chat app

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Socialize with other remote student during your breaks.

## Summary ##
  > HRR Kitchen allows students to meet, chat, and share project ideas during break times. It helps everyone to get to know each other and generate cool product ideas!

## Problem ##
  > Students in Hack Reactor's Remote Program are disadvantaged in that they don't have many opportunities to socialize outside of formal pairing sessions. Thus, they lack opportunities to get to know each other on a deep interpersonal level and build a strong community with their fellow cohort-mates.

## Solution ##
  > The Kitchen offers students a chance to socialize and connect with other outside of any offical pairing or classroom dynamic. Its a place comparable to a real lunchroom at school where students can interact with each other without the threat of lurking teachers.

## Quote from You ##
  >"We wanted a way for the students to interact and get to know each other initially and this provided a quick way for them to 'meet and greet'. It's simple to use and they can sit down at any number of tables and move around as well."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Take a seat at one of the tables, by clicking on an empty seat. If there's other people already at the table, use the provided hangout link to join the conversation. If you're the first, set up a hangout yourself and wait for friends to join!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "This was so easy to use and was a great way to get to know the other remote students. Invaluable during the first week of a cohort when you're just getting to know everyone and you're not face-to-face!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Try it out! Take a seat and meet your fellow students!
